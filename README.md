# Task Scheduler for STM32F-DISCOVERY Board
This is a Task Scheduler which schedules 4 tasks for some fixed intervals of time.
The tasks are the 4 LEDs present on the discovery board.

By Using the **Inline Assembly** to access various **Peripherals** and **Stack Memory** .
And by using concepts such as *Context Switching* to switch between tasks.
